# DBMS: The Why-First Engineer's Handbook

Welcome to **DBMS: TWFEH**.  
If you're wondering what this repo is all about, here's the backstory behind it.

---

### 📖 Backstory

I was searching for a **comprehensive course** — and that too, of course, free — that would be both **theoretically complete** for GATE-level prep and **practically relevant** for a founding engineer’s toolkit.

And I couldn’t really find anything that offered both in a structured and reliable way.

That’s when I thought — why not leverage the open-source community here on GitHub and **build my own**?  
This way, I’d have a resource I can always turn back to — and maybe even improve with help from engineers out there.

I'm appearing for **GATE not as a career goal**, but as a way to **stay sharp and regularly check where I stand in terms of my CS fundamentals**. And when that time comes, I don’t want to search through a hundred videos again — I want to revisit this single, solid repo.

The same applies when I’m working on real-world projects. If I need to **refresh DB concepts** or understand a **new system design pattern**, I want to come back here — not start from scratch every time.

That’s the backstory.

This repo follows a **"Why-First" approach** — because before diving into the *how* or *what*, it’s crucial to understand **why** a topic exists and how it fits into the bigger picture — whether it’s for a GATE question or a startup system.

### 👨‍💻 Who Is This For?

As the backstory points out, this repo is for:

- Engineers preparing for **GATE**, **interviews**, or **academic exams**
- Builders, founders, and future **system designers**
- Anyone who wants to not just **learn databases**, but actually **build with them**

## 📚 Curriculum Structure

Each chapter follows this flow:

1. **Why** – Understand the *problem or system need* behind each concept  
2. **Topics** – Learn the core concepts, syntax, and theory  
3. **Use Case** – See how it applies in real-world systems  
4. **Code/Queries** – Apply the knowledge through hands-on examples
