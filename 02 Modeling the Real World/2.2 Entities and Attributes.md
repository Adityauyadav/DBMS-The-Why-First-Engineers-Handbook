# 📘 2.2 – Entities and Attributes

---

### 🧠 The Why

To build any system — whether it's a school database or a hospital management app — you first need to identify **what exists in that system**.

> In data modeling, these "things that exist" are called **Entities**, and the "information we know about them" are called **Attributes**.

Getting this right is the first step to building a good schema.

### 🔹 What is an Entity?

An **Entity** is a real-world object or concept that we want to store data about.

It can be:
- A **person** → Student, Doctor, Customer
- A **place** → Store, City, Warehouse
- A **thing** → Product, Book, Car
- An **event** → Order, Payment, Exam

We represent each entity as a **table** in a relational database.

---

### 🔸 What are Attributes?

Attributes are **properties** or **details** that describe an entity.

For example:

| Entity | Attributes |
|--------|------------|
| Student | ID, Name, Age, Branch |
| Book | ISBN, Title, Author, Price |
| Order | OrderID, CustomerID, Date, Amount |

Each attribute becomes a **column** in the table that represents the entity.

### 🧱 Entity Representation (ER Style)

In an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
- Entities are drawn as **rectangles**
- Attributes are drawn as **ellipses**
- The **primary key** is usually underlined

Below is the image depicting the symbols used.

Example: Teacher - Student 

Both of the below represented ways are a form of creating a ER Diagram

You can see an underline below the ID No. in Teacher and Roll No. in Student, that is to represent the Primary Key, which we will discuss further
that what are keys and it's types.

### 🎯 Rules of Thumb to Identify Entities

When modeling a system, ask:
1. Is this a **noun** in the problem domain?
2. Will this have **multiple records** over time?
3. Does it have **multiple properties**?
4. Will other things relate to this?

If YES → it's probably an entity.

### 🧪 Real-World Example: Online Learning Platform

Let’s say you’re modeling **Coursera**.

Entities might be:
- **User** → name, email, password, role
- **Course** → title, category, instructor
- **Enrollment** → which user enrolled in which course
- **Quiz** → questions, marks, deadline

Later in this chapter, we’ll define **relationships** among these entities.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Better Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| Making attributes into entities | Keep Name, Age as part of Student, not separate entities |
| Ignoring plural relationships | Model many-to-many (e.g., Users ↔ Courses) |
| Using ambiguous attribute names | Use descriptive names: `course_title` > `title` |

---

### 🧠 Summary

- **Entities** are core objects in your system  
- **Attributes** are their properties  
- This maps directly to **tables and columns** in a relational DB  
- Start by modeling nouns, and keep attributes descriptive and atomic
